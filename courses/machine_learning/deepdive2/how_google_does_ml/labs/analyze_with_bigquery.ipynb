    "BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a publicly available ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into a table in BigQuery. In this lab, you use a copy of that dataset. Sample scenarios are provided, from which you look at the data and ways to remove duplicate information. The lab then steps you through further analysis the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery can be accessed by its own browser-based interface, Google Data Studio, and many third party tools.  In this lab you will use the BigQuery Command Line interface exposed to the JuypterLab notebook via a Python library.\n",
